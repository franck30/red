# Android application for TVFoot

This is a side project I use to learn new things, experiment with new technologies and allow TVFoot user to fully enjoy their Android experience.

## Implementation

The code is organized based on the [Model-View-Intent architecture](https://speakerdeck.com/oldergod/model-view-intent-for-android) which I think is great and worth exploring further.

The app is written in Kotlin and uses many goodies like [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger), [Constraint Layout](https://constraintlayout.com/), [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit/), the [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html), etc.

## PlayStore

The app is published on the PlayStore [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benoitquenaudon.tvfoot.red). Don't hesitate to ask for features if you are an actual user of the app.
